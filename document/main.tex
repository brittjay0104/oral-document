\section{Introduction}


\fbox{
	\parbox{\textwidth}{If program analysis \emph{tool use} is a form of \emph{communication} and \emph{inability to resolve} notifications is \emph{miscommunication}, tools can adopt a theory similar to \emph{constructivism} where tools can \emph{approximate} individual developer's \emph{conceptual knowledge} to adapt notifications, leading to \emph{reduced time and effort} required for developers to resolve tool notifications.

Valerie is a software developer at a start-up company. She primarily writes Java code, though she did not learn to program in Java, and uses the Eclipse Integrated Development Environment (IDE). In her spare time, she builds her knowledge of Java programming concepts by contributing to open source software. While modifying code in the Sun JDK source code repository, she contributes code that results in the notification shown in Figure~\ref{fig:eclipse}. She has experience using FindBugs, so she is familiar with some of the ways FindBugs communicates. For example, she knows that an orange bug icon indicates a \textit{scary} bug and that by clicking the bug icon she can gain access to more information about the bug.

As she explores the information provided by FindBugs, she realizes that despite her experience with FindBugs, she is having difficulty determining how to resolve the notification. She first attempts to use what knowledge she does have regarding multi-threading, which she accrued from resolving compiler synchronization warnings, to better understand the problem; however, she is unfamiliar with the concept central to the notification in Figure~\ref{fig:eclipse} (lazy initialization). Though the notification tells her.... , she is unable to make a connection between her knowledge regarding multi-threading and the message FindBugs is attempting to communicate and therefore cannot resolve the notification without outside help.

% TODO compiler synchronization notification??

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/eclipse-2.png}
	\caption{Findbugs notification in the Eclipse IDE on checking string equality.}
	\label{fig:eclipse2}
\end{figure}

Valerie's goal when using tools like FindBugs is to help her learn more about Java programming concepts, however she finds that some notifications are better at communicating problems while contributing to knowledge than others. For example, when first learning how to work with strings in Java, Valerie encountered the notification in Figure~\ref{fig:eclipse2}. The first time she encountered the problem she was able to understand and resolve the notification. Looking back, she realizes this is because the notification in Figure~\ref{fig:eclipse2} filled in gaps in her own knowledge of the concept by ... 

Because the tools she uses are not familiar with what she does and does not know, the notifications the tools use run the risk of miscommunication with the developer.

% bespoke paper (focused on notifications - fse)


\section{Experiments \& Evaluations}

% generalizability assessment (other concepts)
% study 1: apply model to other concepts; do models differ based on concept? Is there some unifying factor that ties together conceptts per model?
% study 2: predicting knowledge on new set of developers for concepts; how well do models perform on other data? how well does it scale?

% notification adaptations
% study 1: design notifications based on existing research; user study to determine which are better for which group (and maybe some participatory design)
% tool: automatically apply predicted knowledge to adapt
% study 2: compare performance between our tool and FindBugs
